// fuzz tutorial: https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz

// With fuzzing, random data is run against your test in an attempt to find vulnerabilities or crash-causing inputs.
// Some examples of vulnerabilities that can be found by fuzzing are SQL injection, buffer overflow, denial of service and cross-site scripting attacks.

// Reverse accept a string, loop over it a byte at a time, and return the reversed string at the end.
// This code is based on the stringutil.Reverse function within golang.org/x/example.

	}
	return string(b)
}

// The entire seed corpus used strings in which every character was a single byte.
// However, characters such as æ³ƒ can require several bytes. Thus, reversing the string byte-by-byte will invalidate multi-byte characters.
// The key difference is that Reverse is now iterating over each rune in the string, rather than each byte.
